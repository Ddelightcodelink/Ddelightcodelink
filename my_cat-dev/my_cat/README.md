# Welcome to My Cat
***

## Task
The project does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line. Understanding how to use while loop and read syntax was a challenge.

## Description
In this project I first check if there are any command-line arguments passed to the program. If there are, a loop that iterates over all filenames passed as arguments was implemented. Open function is used to open the file in read-only mode and the O_RDONLY flag, returns a file descriptor (a small integer value that represents the file opened by the process). 

## Installation
You can compile the code use gcc my_cat.c -o cat.


## Usage
Run the code using the following command: ./my_cat [filename1] [filename2] ... Replace [filename1], [filename2], etc. with the names of the files you want to concatenate. 
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
