These projects implement simple beginner exercises. 
Project1: my_firstcode.js display Hello World using `console.log` while my_firstcode.c uses `printf`.
Project2: This include exercises to implement increment ++ and decrement == my_index value respectively. multi_var.js seeks to experiment declarations of variables and their usage in `console.log` I also practice with if else statement in js- myIf_Else.js.
