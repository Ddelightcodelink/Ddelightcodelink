# Welcome to My Tetris
Tetris game requires players to rotate and move falling Tetris pieces. Players clear lines by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty cells. But, if the pieces reach the top, the game is over!

## Task
A Tetris Game Implementation. This project is a demonstration of JavaScript to implement tetris game. Tetris was the first game to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element case of polyominoes, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907.
## Description
I created the following file: index.html, styles.css, constants.js, pieces.js, and tetris.js. The index.html is the interface, styles.css is the design while the javascripts were splited to three of which tetris is the main js that controls the pieces.js and constants.js.
I was able to accomplishe this task with the help of resources from the following web pages: 
https://michael-karen.medium.com/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057
https://www.codewithfaraz.com/content/141/creating-a-tetris-game-with-javascript couple with other sources like YouTube videos and ChatGPT.

## Installation
javascripts server will be run to start the program. This is stored in the html_server.js. Start the game by entering this code: node html_server.js at your IDE terminal.
## Usage
The game is played using the computer keys such as arrow keys: Left. Up, Right, space bar, Esc etc. Use the up arrow key or X to rotates the tetrominoes.
The game score and levels will also be displayed.
